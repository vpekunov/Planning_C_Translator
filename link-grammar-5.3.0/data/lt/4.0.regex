% We demand that these end with an alphanumeric, i.e. explicitly
% reject punctuation. We don't want this regex to "swallow" any trailing

% (... any affix, for that matter ...) and so no embedded apostrophe

% This matters only for punc. appearing in the affix table, since the
% tokenizer explicitly mangles based on these punctution marks.
