                 Java Bindings for Link Grammar
                 ------------------------------

These files implement Java language bindings for Link Grammar. They do
not extend the parsing algorithms already present in Link-Grammar in
any way. They do, however, allow certain types of remote/server
operation, and, in particular, are needed for use by the RelEx
dependency parser.

The shell script link-grammar-server.sh demonstrates how to run the
parser server.  Once the server is started, parses can be obtained
by using ordinary TCPIP sockets; so, for example:

   echo "text:this is a test" | nc localhost 9000

will return a JSON-encoded parse of the sentence "this is a test".
The diagram string can be obtained with:

   echo "storeDiagramString:true, text:this is a test" | nc localhost 9000

The port number 9000 is configurable; the language, dictionary path
and number of threads to use can also be specified.  See the shell
script for details.
