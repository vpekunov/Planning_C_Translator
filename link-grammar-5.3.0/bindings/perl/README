                 Perl bindings to Link Grammar
                 -----------------------------

NOTE:  These are "low-level" autogenerated bindings for perl. A superior
set of perl bindings are the Lingua Link Parser bindings, which can be
found at http://search.cpan.org/~dbrian/Lingua-LinkParser/  You should
almost surely be using those instead of these, here.

See example.pl for a demo.
