--
-- SQLite3 style SQL commands to create the tables holding the various
-- dictionary bits and pieces.  Right now, this is just a very simple
-- pair of tables, one to hold word classes, and another to hold all
-- the disjuncts for that class.
--
-- To create a new database, simply say:
--    cat dict.sql | sqlite3 dict.db
-- To populate it with the demo data:
--    cat demo.sql | sqlite3 dict.db

CREATE TABLE Morphemes

	-- always unique for the dictionary.

	-- All words/morphemes sharing this classname also share this
	-- disjunct and cost.
	classname TEXT NOT NULL,

	-- The standard Link Grammar disjunct, expressed as an ASCII string.
	-- The disjunct can be composed of the & operator, and the optional
	-- connectors i.e. {} and the multiple connector i.e. @. The and
	-- operator is NOT allowed. This means that the grouping parents () 
	-- must also not appear in the expression.  The cost operators [] are
	-- also not allowed; costs are to be expressed using the cost field.

	-- An example of a valid disjunct:
	--     A+ & B- & {Ca*bc*f+} & @Mpqr-

	-- An example of an INVALID disjunct:
